    "* 'r' (read-only): This mode allows you to read the contents of a file, but not modify it. If the file does not exist, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 'w' (write): This mode allows you to write to a file, overwriting any existing content. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",

    "\n",
    "* 'x' (exclusive creation): This mode is similar to 'w', but it will raise an error if the file already exists.\n",

    "Ans 2:- The close() function is used to close a file after it has been opened and used for reading or writing data. It is important to close a file after you are done working with it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To save resources: When you open a file, the operating system assigns a certain amount of resources to keep track of that file while it is being used. If you do not close the file, those resources will continue to be used until the program terminates, which can cause performance issues or even crashes if too many files are left open.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To ensure data integrity: If you write data to a file and do not close it properly, there is a risk that some of the data may not be saved. This is because some operating systems buffer data before writing it to disk, and closing the file ensures that all data is written to disk before the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To avoid file locking issues: When a file is opened for writing, it may be \"locked\" by the operating system to prevent other programs from accessing it while it is being modified. If you do not close the file properly, it may remain locked, preventing other programs from accessing it even if your program has finished using it."
